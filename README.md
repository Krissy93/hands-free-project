# Hands-Free Project Repository
Welcome to the Hands-Free Project of Vis4Mechs, University of Brescia, Italy!
The project aims to give users a smart way to teleoperate a robot using their hands. This allows the robot to work in a working area that can be either (i) the same of the operator or (ii) a different one, even positioned far away from the operator itself (e. g. a robot placed behind a safety cage, which works far away from the operator, or a Collaborative Robot, which usually works in the same working area of the operator).
